# Apriltag Tracker for FRC

TagTracker is the first FRC implementation of the AprilTag standard capable of full robot localization. It achieves this by combining estimated poses of multiple tags, even across multiple cameras!

This project was made public by FRC Team 2129, Ultraviolet.
This project was modified by FRC Team 4533, Pheonix Robotics.
