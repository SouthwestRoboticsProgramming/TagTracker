# Apriltag Tracker for FRC

## This is no longer actively maintained
Use [TagTracker-v2](https://github.com/SouthwestRoboticsProgramming/TagTracker-v2) instead.

TagTracker is the first FRC implementation of the AprilTag standard capable of full robot localization. It achieves this by combining estimated poses of multiple tags, even across multiple cameras!
